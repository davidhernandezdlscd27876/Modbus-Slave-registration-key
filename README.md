### **Use Cases**
Here are five main use cases for a Modbus Slave device, formatted in Markdown as bullet points:



- **Data Acquisition**: Collecting sensor data (e.g., temperature, pressure, or flow) from industrial equipment and transmitting it to a Modbus Master for monitoring and analysis.  

- **Device Control**: Acting as a controlled device that receives commands from a Modbus Master to operate actuators, valves, or other machinery.  

- **Remote Monitoring**: Enabling real-time monitoring of remote systems, such as energy meters, water treatment plants, or HVAC systems, by providing data to a central control system.  

- **Integration with SCADA Systems**: Serving as a data source for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems to facilitate centralized control and visualization of industrial processes.  

- **Interfacing Legacy Equipment**: Bridging older industrial devices with modern control systems by converting proprietary protocols to Modbus for seamless communication.
